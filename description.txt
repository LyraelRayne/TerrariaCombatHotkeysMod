Combat Hotkeys adds four hotkeys that allow quick-using of the last 4 items on the hotbar.

Default key bindings are "C", "X", "Z", "Q".

Mounts don't seem to work at the moment, other item types may also fail.

Currently known to work with placeable items and (AFAIK) all kinds of weapon.

Note: Setting the hotkeys to number keys will prevent the mod from restoring your original item selection because Terraria hard-codes the number keys even if you turn off the keybind.
